Summing Proper Divisors to Generate Sequences with Interesting Dynamics
=======================================================================

Consider each integer as the initial value of a sequence which converges to some 'attractor'.  The next element of the sequence is generated by summing the proper divisors of the current element.  The possible attractors are zero, infinity, perfect numbers, amicable pairs and sociable chains.

Each number is plotted as a vertical bar whose color indicates the attractor its sequence converges to.  The sequences for most integers tend to the attractors at zero and infinity, which are colored black and white respectively.

The main difficulty is that I'm not able to prove that any given sequence of numbers diverges to infinity.  There seems to be always the possibility that the sum of proper divisors, even of a very large number, could be a prime or an element of an amicable pair or sociable chain.

So far, the best I can do is to say that if the number hasn't converged to a cycle, chain, or fixed number after some large number of iterations and/or if it reaches some extremely large number, I suppose its attractor to be infinity.  The relatively smooth appearance of most sequence generated from this algorithm seems to justify that strategy, but there are likely some numbers labled as diverging to infinity which in fact converge.

Assigning the color black to zero, white to (probably) infinity and different colors for the various perfect numbers, amicable pairs, etc. and organizing the numbers in rows, so as to make good use of the canvas, reveals a suprising amount of structure in the resulting dynamics.

To make the process of checking all the integers for a given range reasonably efficient, before generating a sequence for an integer, we check an array/hash to see if the number has already been assigned a color/attractor, since it may be an element of a previously computed sequence.  We also check to see if a generated number is in our list of known attractors.

This plot revealed quite a bit of surprising structure.  Strong vertical white lines appear on odd multiples of 6.  Checkerboard patterns, alternating between zero and infinite attractors, appear quite frequently.
